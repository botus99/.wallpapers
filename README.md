# .wallpapers

Welcome to my collection of super awesome wallpapers! 😊 I like to keep my wallpapers in a hidden folder. These wallpapers are not currently organized, and were obtained from various YouTuber's repos. I went through and deleted any obviously copyrighted material (plus anything that I didn't like). Please feel free to contact me if you find something that I missed and I will remove at upon request.

These wallpapers are sourced from various talented YouTubers such as Distrotube, Brodie, and others. I've also included some from popular desktop environments like Gnome and XFCE. Whether you're looking for a minimalistic, abstract, or nature-inspired design, I've got something for everyone. 🎨

What sets these wallpapers apart is that many of them have been optimized using OptiPNG and Curtail. This means that not only do they look great, but they'll also consume less storage space and load faster on your device. Enjoy a smoother and more seamless experience while admiring the beauty of these wallpapers. 💻

Feel free to browse through my collection and find the perfect wallpaper to match your style and mood. These wallpapers come in various resolutions, so no matter what device you're using, you can enjoy a stunning background that will make your screen stand out. 📱🖥️
