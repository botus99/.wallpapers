# .wallpapers
I like to keep my wallpapers in a hidden folder. These wallpapers are not currently organized, and were obtained from various YouTuber's repos.
I went through and deleted any obviously copyrighted material (plus anything that I didn't like). Please feel free to contact me if you find something that I missed and I will remove at upon request.

Hope you enjoy this wallpaper collection!
