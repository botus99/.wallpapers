# .wallpapers

These wallpapers are barely organized. If you care about filenames, you might hate this. If you just want things loosely organized in folders, this repo should work well enough for you. Some wallpapers in this repo are sourced from talented YouTubers such as Distrotube, Brodie, and others. Various subreddits were pilfered using [wppfzf](https://github.com/channel-42/wppfzf). Some other wallpapers are from popular desktop environments like Gnome and XFCE. This collection has something for everyone and was created taking something from everyone. 🥷

Note the large collection of gruvbox (my preferred color scheme) wallpapers in the color-scheme folder. It includes many custom made wallpapers created with [Image-Go-Nord](https://ign.schroedinger-hat.org/), [gruvbox_factory](https://github.com/paulopacitti/gruvbox-factory), [xnconvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/), or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). 🎨

[OxiPNG](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) and [Curtail](https://github.com/Huluti/Curtail) are used in this collection to minimize file sizes losslessly. Enjoy a snappy experience while browsing to find your next wallpaper! 📱💻
