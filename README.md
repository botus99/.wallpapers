# .wallpapers

These wallpapers are not organized very well (eh, I'll get there someday). They are sourced from talented YouTubers such as Distrotube, Brodie, and others. Various subreddits were pilfered using [wppfzf](https://github.com/channel-42/wppfzf). Some are from popular desktop environments like Gnome and XFCE. This collection has something for everyone. 🃏

Note the large collection of gruvbox (my preferred color scheme) wallpapers in the color-scheme folder. It includes many custom made wallpapers created with [Image-Go-Nord](https://ign.schroedinger-hat.org/), [gruvbox_factory](https://github.com/paulopacitti/gruvbox-factory), [xnconvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/), or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). 🎨

[OxiPNG](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) and [Curtail](https://github.com/Huluti/Curtail) are used in this collection to minimize file sizes. Enjoy a snappy experience while browsing these wallpapers. 💻
